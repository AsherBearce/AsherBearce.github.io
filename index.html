                Hello! My name is Asher Bearce, I am a 20-year-old developer with around 10 years of programming experience. 
                I know many languages such as Java, C#, C++, etc. I am also very proficient with mathematics, as the highest 
                level of math I am comfortable with is Tensor Calculus. I've worked on many projects, a few being a physics engine,
                the winning app submitted for the congressional app challenge known as Chromatilt, and a few other things. 
                My true passion has been mostly in game programming and graphics programming, however I have explored many other
                areas of programming such as web design, programming language design, and app development. Check out my Github in
                the link below, or you can check out various projects I have, also in the links below!
