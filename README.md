Hello! I'm a 20-year-old math and computer-science enthusiast. My main things I like to work on include game engine development, language design, and most math related things. I'm mostly self-taught in both math and programming, of which I've had 10 years experience in total, and 6 years of serious programming experience. Please hire me?
